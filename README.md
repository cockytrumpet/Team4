### Day/Time/TimeZone for the scheduled team weekly meeting (30 minutes via Zoom)
Thursdays, 7 p.m. - 7:30 p.m. MT

### Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
Enable custom storage, retrieval, and search of commonly used resources by abstracting away complex database and infrastructure.

### Motivation: why are you working on this project?
It's really annoying to keep track of many different resources and links that a team may need to keep track of or use. 
We want people to be able to make their own curated reference system that meets their specific use case, without the struggle of building an end-to-end system.

### Risks to project completion, possibly including:
Unclear on what systems or resources we have access to - we know we need a database, domain, server.

New languages - SQL, Javascript (common front-end languages), Java (common back-end languages).

In aggregate, little to no experience with full stack application development.

In aggregate, little to no experience leading scrum teams or agile teams.

### Mitigation Strategy for above risks
Reach out to professor early to determine how to obtain needed resources, and explore free prototyping options. 

Explore online resources and documentation, and enable team members with more experience to coach others. 

Explore online resources and trainings that provide demos on how to build a small prototype full stack web application. 

Continue to leverage materials provided in class about how to lead an agile/scrum team, and enable ongoing feedback mechanisms to ensure team members can voice concerns and we can continue to improve. 

### Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
Scrumban: 
Combination of scrum and kanban, where we leverage the meeting structure, prioritization, and cadence of scrum 
(meetings every week, recurring stand-ups) but allow for continuous integration of new work as bandwidth changes, and focus on limiting work in progress, with a focus on continous flow of work with the structure and timing of scrum. 

We will meet every week for our scrum, and have check-ins as needed via discord.
We will raise blockers as they come, and maintain a backlog of future work, pulling in new items as we have bandwidth, with a limit on how many stories can be in progress at any time.
