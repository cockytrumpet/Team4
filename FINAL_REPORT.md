## Final Status Report
### What we completed:
- Hosting and deployment of full stack application
- Complex schema with 6 separate tables, representing many-to-many relationships between 3 distinct object types
- Log-in demo functionality to hide information from the user until authenticated
- Intuitive resource management tool with easy access to create, edit, and delete resources, tags, and projects
- Custom HTML and CSS formatting to create beautiful, high speed rendering of custom UI
### What we were in the middle of implementing
- We were in the middle of developing additional unit tests to improve code coverage
- Intuitive search capability for 'fuzzy text' searching, beyond just searching by exact tag or resource title
### What we had planned for the future
- Integration tests, including automated testing of Flask
- Actual authentication of the user
- Customized view of the tooling based on custom preferences
### Any known problems (bugs, issues)
- sometimes inconsistent rendering of images
- lack of error handling can cause unexpected behavior if there is disconnect from database or other unexpected input from the user
